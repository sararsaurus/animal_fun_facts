I adapted a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-introduction) exercise so that it could live in the wild!

- I generated the CSS (and images) from scratch
- I adapated the older syntax (the exercise relied on ReactDOM.render(), for example) to React 18 throughout.
- Codecademy assumes you'll use their inbuilt environment; instead I created my project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
